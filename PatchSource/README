Morphing patches dedicated to RebelTech Owl module and prototypes
These wavetable patches use frequency range wavetables to go from a complex harmonic rich signal in LF to a simple sine wave in HF. So there won't be any aliasing in HF and no distinctive sound changes between wavetables.

extwaves folder contain a program that generates a float array from .wav files .
